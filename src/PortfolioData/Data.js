export const ABOUT_TEXT = `
Hello! I'm a dedicated and determined fourth-year BTech student with a keen interest in JAVA development. I recently completed an enriching internship at Webethics, where I worked as a Java Developer. My technical prowess spans JAVA, Spring Boot, Hibernate, microservices, SQL, system design, DSA, ReactJS, Git, GitHub, and MongoDB.

My relentless curiosity and disciplined approach to work drive me to tackle challenges head-on and deliver high-quality solutions. Outside of coding, I channel my energy into the gym, cricket, and kho-kho—I’m proud to be a national-level kho-kho player!

Looking ahead, my aspirations are rooted in making a meaningful impact on society and uplifting the underprivileged. I strive not just for personal growth but also for contributing positively to the community.
